# findme
an app to filter out pics from a folder that contains a specific face. 

## Motivation
This project was born out of impatience. Impatience to find photos where I appear from a folder that contains all images taken in a trip. 

Simple solution:
(Motivated from google photos' offline face clustering feature , but was in a dire need to find a real time filter done on a specific folder)
- Provide a face (A query face)
- Run face recognition and cluster all faces in the folder
- filter images that contain the queried face. 
- As simple as that

## Test set : 
- Created a dataset of all the poster from the eng sit com "Office"
- filtered all images which features "Pam"

TODO : 
>> Could not find time to create an app. 
>> Make run time optimisations
